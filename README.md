# archive-browser

Frontend for [Ragtag Archive](https://archive.ragtag.moe).

## Deploy

If you want to use this frontend for your own purposes, you can check the config file at `modules/shared/config.ts`, and make appropriate changes to connect it to your backend. For more info, read `doc/DEPLOY.md`.

Note that this project only includes the web interface, and does not include other parts such as archival tools. You should use your own tools to archive and index content.
