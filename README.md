# archive-browser

Frontend for [Ragtag Archive](https://archive.ragtag.moe).

## Deploy

Check out [aonahara/archive-docker](https://gitlab.com/aonahara/archive-docker) to quickly set up a local copy of Ragtag Archive.

If you want to use this frontend for your own purposes, you can check the config file at [`modules/shared/config.ts`](https://gitlab.com/aonahara/archive-browser/-/blob/master/modules/shared/config.ts), and make appropriate changes to connect it to your backend. For more info, read [`doc/DEPLOY.md`](https://gitlab.com/aonahara/archive-browser/-/blob/master/doc/DEPLOY.md).

Note that this project only includes the web interface, and does not include other parts such as archival tools. You should use your own tools to archive and index content.
